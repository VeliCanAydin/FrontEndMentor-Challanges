## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to repeat the media queries and refreshed my knowledge.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
  .
  .
  .
}
```

### Continued development

In the upcoming challenges, I want to implement much more advanced concepts of react and maybe use a CSS-in-JS framework or a CSS preprocessor like SASS.
