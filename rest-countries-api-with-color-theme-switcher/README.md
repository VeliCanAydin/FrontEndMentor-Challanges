### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to integrate a public API into a Next.js application efficiently. I also improved my understanding of dynamic routing in Next.js and how to handle client-side navigation. Implementing the dark mode toggle using TailwindCSS and Next.js context API was a great learning experience.
