## My process

In this challenge, I used flexbox layout for the entire site. Using the grid at the bottom of the site where the course cards are located would have provided more advantages and I could have completed the project faster, but I could not predict this at the beginning. In addition, as a result of an approach mistake I made at the beginning of the project, it was impossible for me to add the pictures perfectly to the site. For this reason, I tried to find the original pictures from the internet and recreate the same design with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

Technically, I didn't learn anything new, but I realized that the choices we'll make as we launch our project need to be made much more carefully. Otherwise, we may encounter much more work in the future.

### Continued development

I need to improve myself on responsive design and aim to write cleaner css. In the next challenges, I have to determine a much more detailed workflow and focus on writing much cleaner code.ques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
